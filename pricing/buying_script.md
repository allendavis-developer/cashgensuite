## **Negotiation Script Sheet**

### **Core Framing Principle: Half/Half / 50/50**

* **Concept:**

  * The item has a retail value.
  * You base your offer on a fraction of that value (e.g., quarter the retail price).
  * Your selling price is double your “purchase price.”
  * When negotiating, present this as a fair compromise: *“Let’s meet halfway.”*

* **Tactical Advantages:**

  * Anchors the conversation in reality.
  * Shows transparency and fairness.
  * Gives the customer a sense of control by offering a counter-number.

### **Scenario 1: Customer Asking a Reasonable Price**

* **Tactic:** Reinforce fairness and willingness to meet them.
* **Script:**

  1. Customer states price.
  2. You: *“I can’t guarantee I’ll get exactly there, but I’ll do my best to make this work.”*
  3. If acceptable: *“Great, this aligns closely with my price point, so we can move forward.”*
* **Tips:**

  * Maintain positive tone.
  * Avoid over-explaining; keep it concise.
  * Shows you’re cooperative but still professional.

### **Scenario 2: Customer Asking Slightly Too High**

* **Tactic:** Use gentle pushback + alternative choice.

* **Script:**

  1. Customer gives higher-than-ideal price.
  2. You: *“Pricing may struggle to reach that level.”*
  3. You: *“If that doesn’t work, is there another number you’d feel comfortable with?”*
  4. Customer suggests a counter.
  5. You: *“Ok, I’ll do my best to meet you as close as possible to that.”*

* **Tips:**

  * Offer flexibility without giving away too much.
  * Phrase as a joint problem-solving exercise: *“Let’s find a number that works for both of us.”*
  * Use tone to reinforce fairness, not rigidity.

### **Scenario 3: Customer Asking Too High**

* **Tactic:** Use backstory + anchoring + 50/50 compromise.

* **Script:**

  1. Customer gives very high price.
  2. You: *“I have to be honest, it’s unlikely pricing will reach that level.”*
  3. You: *“Is there another number you’d feel comfortable with?”*
  4. Customer responds.
  5. You: *“Even that might still be a little high, given the amount I need to cover. Here’s an idea: the item typically has a market value, and my pricing is based on a fair fraction of that. To make it work for both of us, we could meet halfway.”*
  6. If they push again: *“I want this to be fair for both of us, so I can’t go higher than this compromise. This way, you’re getting value and I’m covering costs.”*

* **Tips:**

  * Use transparent reasoning: frames you as trustworthy.
  * Offer a concrete compromise (50/50 or “meet halfway”) without exact numbers.
  * Let the customer feel they’re part of the solution.

### **Extra Negotiation Techniques Embedded**

1. **Anchoring:**

   * Establish the “retail value → quarter → double” logic early; it sets expectations.
2. **Reciprocity:**

   * “I’m trying my best” signals goodwill; they’re more likely to reciprocate with flexibility.
3. **Choice & Control:**

   * Always ask: *“Is there another number that works for you?”*
   * Makes them feel ownership of the deal.
4. **Framing:**

   * “This is a fair compromise based on market value” frames your offer as reasonable, not arbitrary.
