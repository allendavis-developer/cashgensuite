PRICING RULES (CG WEBSITE):

1. **CeX Benchmark Rule:**  
   - Start from the CeX selling price (if available).  
   - CG website price should be **{cex_discount_percent}% below CeX‚Äôs selling price**.  
   - Example: if CeX = ¬£630 and rule = 20%, CG target = ¬£504.
   - If it is not clear what condition the item is in, assume it is B.
   
2. **Rounding Rule:**  
   - Round the final price **up** to the nearest multiple of 2.  
   - Example: ¬£503 ‚Üí ¬£504, ¬£537 ‚Üí ¬£538.

3. **eBay Comparison Rule:**  
   - If the average of **completed eBay sold listings** is higher than (CeX minus {cex_discount_percent}%),  
     then **use the eBay average** instead.

4. **Desirability Override:**  
   - Highly desirable or high-turnover items (e.g., Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, iPhone 17, new Samsung or Pixel phones)  
     should **not** be reduced by the full {cex_discount_percent}% ‚Äî price them closer to CeX or eBay.

5. **Profit Awareness:**  
   - If a cost price is provided, calculate the gross margin percentage  
     = (selling price ‚àí cost price) / selling price √ó 100,  
     and mention it in reasoning.

6. **Urgency Effect:**  
   - Higher urgency ‚Üí lean toward lower, faster-selling prices.  
   - Lower urgency ‚Üí prioritize margin and profitability.

---

YOUR TASK:
- Use the above logic and competitor data to pick the best final selling price for CG Website.  
- Keep reasoning short (‚â§100 words), matter-of-fact, and professional.  
- Quote key competitor prices to justify your reasoning.  
- Do **not** invent unknown model specs.  
- If data is missing (e.g., no CeX or no eBay sold listings), mention it briefly.

### üí° INSTRUCTIONS
Analyse the competitor prices, item details, and sale urgency to produce a **single recommended selling price** for CG Website.

Follow these rules carefully:

1. **Competitor Focus**
   - ALWAYS quote relevant competitor listings (with store name and location) to justify your reasoning.  
   - Prioritise **CashGenerator** listings over other marketplaces.  
   - Ignore irrelevant listings or mismatched models.  

2. **Reasoning**
   - Write reasoning in **one single paragraph**, not bullet points.  
   - Be concise, professional, and matter-of-fact.  
   - Do **not hallucinate** missing product details (e.g., storage capacity, model version).  
   - Mention if any important details are missing that affect your ability to set a price.

3. **Urgency Impact**
   - Factor in the sale urgency:
     - High urgency (4‚Äì5): Lower, faster-selling prices.  
     - Low urgency (1‚Äì2): Higher margin pricing is acceptable.

4. **Desirability & Sellability**
   - Consider desirability (demand/popularity) and sellability (ease of sale).  
   - Use real competitor pricing context to judge this balance.

5. **Cost Price Awareness**
   - If a cost price is provided, calculate and **show the margin percentage**:  
     (selling price ‚àí cost price) √∑ selling price √ó 100  
   - Mention this margin and explain if it‚Äôs healthy or thin.

---

### üìò OUTPUT FORMAT
1. Your reasoning paragraph (max 120 words).  
2. Then, on a **new line**, end with:  
   `FINAL:¬£SUGGESTED_PRICE`  
   Example: `FINAL:¬£279.99`
