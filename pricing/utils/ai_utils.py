PRICING RULES (CASHGENERATOR WEBSITE):

1. **Top-of-Website Positioning:**  
   - Your goal is to price the item so it appears at the **top of the CashGenerator website listings**, meaning **the lowest visible price**.
   - Ensure your price is lower than the lowest price in CashGenerator.  
   - Use **Cash Converters listings only as a reference** to identify price clusters. **We are not listing items on Cash Converters.**  
   - Aim to place the CashGenerator price **slightly below the main cluster average** using **meaningful psychological steps** (e.g., if cluster ‚âà ¬£89.99, consider ¬£79.99‚Äì¬£84.99) to stand out.  
   - **Do NOT price below a minimum margin of {min_margin_percent}%**, even if cluster positioning suggests a lower price.

2. **Desirability Override:**  
   - Highly desirable or high-turnover items (e.g., Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, iPhone 17, flagship Samsung or Pixel phones)  
     may be priced **closer to CeX or eBay** rather than applying the full discount.

3. **Urgency Effect:**  
   - Higher urgency ‚Üí lower, faster-selling price.  
   - Lower urgency ‚Üí prioritize margin while still aiming for top-of-website placement.

---

YOUR TASK:
- Recommend the **final CashGenerator website price** to achieve **top-of-website visibility** while satisfying minimum margin.  
- Keep reasoning concise (‚â§100 words), professional, and cite competitor prices where relevant.  
- Do **not** invent unknown model specs.  
- If data is missing (e.g., no CeX, no eBay, limited Cash Converters listings), mention it briefly.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Reasoning in one concise paragraph.

Then end your answer with:

### üí° INSTRUCTIONS
Analyse the competitor prices, item details, and sale urgency to produce a **single recommended selling price** for CG Website.

Follow these rules carefully:

1. **Competitor Focus**
   - ALWAYS quote relevant competitor listings (with store name and location) to justify your reasoning.  
   - Prioritise **CashGenerator** listings over other marketplaces.  
   - Ignore irrelevant listings or mismatched models.  

2. **Reasoning**
   - Write reasoning in **one single paragraph**, not bullet points.  
   - Be concise, professional, and matter-of-fact.  
   - Do **not hallucinate** missing product details (e.g., storage capacity, model version).  
   - Mention if any important details are missing that affect your ability to set a price.

3. **Urgency Impact**
   - Factor in the sale urgency:
     - High urgency (4‚Äì5): Lower, faster-selling prices.  
     - Low urgency (1‚Äì2): Higher margin pricing is acceptable.

4. **Desirability & Sellability**
   - Consider desirability (demand/popularity) and sellability (ease of sale).  
   - Use real competitor pricing context to judge this balance.

5. **Cost Price Awareness**
   - If a cost price is provided, calculate and **show the margin percentage**:  
     (selling price ‚àí cost price) √∑ selling price √ó 100  
   - Mention this margin and explain if it‚Äôs healthy or thin.

### üìò OUTPUT FORMAT
1. Your reasoning paragraph (max 120 words).  
2. Then, on a **new line**, end with:  
   `FINAL:¬£SUGGESTED_PRICE`  
   Example: `FINAL:¬£279.99`

Keep your tone factual, data-driven, and confident.
